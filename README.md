## Overview
This project aims to evaluate multiple machine learning models and compare their performance using a bar chart visualization. The models analyzed include:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the models is not included in this repository for privacy reasons. You can substitute your own dataset in the provided code structure.

## Models
The following models were trained and evaluated:
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Random Forest**
3. **Gradient Boosting**

## Evaluation Metrics
The models are evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Measures the overall correctness of the model.
- **Recall**: Measures the ability of the model to correctly identify positive instances.
- **Precision**: Measures the proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/model-performance-comparison.git
   cd model-performance-comparison
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Update the `models`, `accuracy`, `recall`, and `precision` variables in the script to match your results.
2. Run the script to generate the bar plot:
   ```bash
   python plot_metrics.py
   ```
3. The bar chart comparing model performance will be displayed.

## Results
The bar chart below provides a visual comparison of the models based on the evaluation metrics:
